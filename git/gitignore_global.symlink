# Global Git Ignore File
# This file contains patterns that should be ignored across all Git repositories

# Ignore .specstory directory
.specstory/

# the .cursorindexingignore file contains this to avoid specstory files being pulled in:
  # Don't index SpecStory auto-save files, but allow explicit context inclusion via @ references
  # .specstory/**
# so we'll ignore the cursor ignore file, to prevent it being pulled into the repo shared with everyone else
.cursorindexingignore
